beginner-research-cookiecutter
==============================

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)  that generates a very basic directory layout and
documentation for computational research projects

Code and data shared in a clean fashion makes a publication easier to replicate. This cookiecutter is intended
to guide researchers through the steps of creating an organized layout for their work. It's also intended to 
guide researchers through some basic concepts for what exactly work is in terms of computational research.

Based on following the http://software-carpentry.org blog and materials, a lot of computational scientists
aren't familiar with shell scripts, organized directory trees, packaging, and other similar concepts.
Given that people aren't familiar with these concerns, the first iteration of the cookiecutter project 
will have very humble goals. It doesn't have to generate anything very complex. It
will just provide some basic directory structure with a simple checklist for what one might want to
include in it.
