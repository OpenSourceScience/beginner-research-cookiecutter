beginner-research-cookiecutter
==============================

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)  that generates a very basic directory layout and
documentation for computational research projects

Code and data shared in a clean fashion makes a publication easier to replicate. This cookiecutter is intended
to guide researchers through the steps of creating an organized layout for their work. It's also intended to 
guide researchers through some basic concepts for what exactly work is in terms of computational research.
